I learned how to use Github.
I already learned how to make a pull request, communicate with other developers.
I also learned how to clone a repository and update it and push to remote repository.
and I noticed that most of the time for the newbie like me is having trouble in pushing
to remote repository because the remote reposity default is "main" and git local repository
default is master. It is important to use a command "git branch -M main" to avoid future
conflict in remote repository when having a pull request or pushing to the remote repository.
